Not playing mc anymore bc of the elder guardians.  
Call me a wussy and a coward all u want but I didn't blow over 50 bucks on a video game to be jumpscared, just to have fun.     
Won't be active much anymore because I'm having a fard ton of nightmares LOL.  
Will still be developing mc mods and plugins mainly focused on removing jumpscare pufferfish entirely from the game.  

Oh and don't give me that garbage about "omg just avoid the ocean monument" or "omg they're just pufferfish" I'm blaming this entirely on Mojang.
GG Mojang you did it again.
