Not playing mc anymore, mostly taking a break from the internet for a bit bc of the elder guardians.  
  
Call me a wussy and a coward and bully me all u want but I didn't blow over 50 bucks on a video game to be jumpscared, just to have fun. Your angriness fuels my sadness anyway LOL!
       
Won't be active much anymore because I'm having a fard ton of nightmares haha.
  
Will still be developing mc mods and plugins mainly focused on removing jumpscare pufferfish entirely from the game.              
  
Don't give me that garbage about "omg just avoid the ocean monument" or "omg they're just pufferfish", even "but if Mojang removes it the veteran players will be angry" stay mad I'm blaming this entirely on Mojang.
